            <p><span id="first4">I made this webpage</span> as a practice
                webpage. Here, I can experiment with different methods, styles,
                and hopefully some Python and JavaScript, just for the practice.
                When I was trying to think of a topic for the webpage, I
                struggled for a while, but I finally settled on showcasing my
                artwork. In the future, I may also add bits of my written works,
                also.</p>
            <p>So far, I'm very proud of the columns shown on this page. On a
                computer screen, you can see three distinct columns. The one on
                the left has a few of my paintings. In the center, obviously, I
                have text content. Then on the right, I have an "About Me"
                section. It was tricky, but I finally managed to style the
                three columns in such a way that they will collapse gracefully
                on narrower screens. On such a screen, there may be two, or even
                only one, column. But the sections are still there, with that
                beautiful header at the top, with the faded background that took
                some research and experimentation to figure out (like most
                things on this page).</p>
